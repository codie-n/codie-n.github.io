This program allows users to check their balance, deposit funds, and withdraw funds. It displays a simple text menu that takes in a number between 1-4 (inclusive) to choose between the 3 main functions or exiting. This program uses a switch case statement to handle the user input and call the appropriate function. Each time the balance is displayed, it is done with two decimal places.

I coded this and tested this using Visual Studio Code. This was for an assignment in my ICS 212 class.

This little program was my first time using switch case statements. Prior to this, I would have used if else statements to make something like this.

You can see my code in my GitHub [Simple Banking System Simulation](https://github.com/codie-n/simplebankingsys).
