## Overview

We found the problem that many of the people you meet as college students are usually within the same majors and fields as you meet most of them in your classes or clubs related to your major. So this is where our website Manoa Connect comes in to allow UH Manoa students to meet people outside of their major and chat with them, making friends along the way. Our site has 4 main features:

- Creating/editing your profile
- Editing your schedule
- Matching with others
- Chatting with friends

## Responsibilities

I was in charge of making the user home page, the profile creation/editing page, and the schedule editing page. I was also an assistant project manager that helped oversee the entire project and make sure each member was on task through our implementation of agile project management.

## Developers

- Aaron Ramos
- Masaki Sakai
